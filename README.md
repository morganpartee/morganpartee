### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm John. I'm a machine learning engineer with a small startup doing really cool shit in oil and gas. I have a masters in data science from SMU, an online computer science BS, and a few years of experience in software, after a while in IT (and automating it!) in the Air Force.

I mostly write Python for work, with some pretty bad Typescript/React for fun.

### (...mostly) Active side projects:

[Tacticle](https://tacticle.co) - Daily chess puzzles, wordle style

[sensibledefaults.io](https://sensibledefaults.io) - Where I've written down a few things I've learned

[pmf.dev](https://pmf.dev) - Low code embeddable surveys and analysis

[OpeningAid.com](https://openingaid.com) - A better way to learn chess openings (...big eventually)

With a few other easy to use ML app ideas floating around in my head, and one or two kinda neat chess app ideas.

### Actively Learning:

Signal processing (oh man did I not learn enough in that time series class)

Business and marketing

MLOps

UX Design, particularly making stuff prettier (which I am *bad* at)

Chess (Add me on [Chess.com](https://www.chess.com/member/morganpartee))
